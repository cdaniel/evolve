        <h1>The Art of War</h1>
        <p>Simon Wardley, in his search to understand how to evaluate strategy, found answers in military history and <em>Sun Tzu: The Art of War</em>. Sun Tzu's Five Factors — Purpose, Landscape, Climate, Doctrine, and Leadership — covered the minimum set of considerations required for strategic decision-making.</p>
        <p>In military contexts, a map formed the basis for understanding the Landscape. But in the absence of a tangible competitive landscape, could there be such a thing as maps in business? To find out, <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">see Simon's book</a> or keep reading.</p>

        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>In Wardley Mapping, <strong>Purpose</strong> is "the game" being played. It defines the scope of what you are doing and why you are doing it. It may be a moral imperative or just what motivates you to come to work every day.</p>
        <p>Purpose is the first step in the strategy cycle. Because many leaders do not understand the importance of Landscape, Climate, and Doctrine, they commonly shortcut the cycle and jump straight from Purpose to strategic decisions in Leadership. This "strategy by gut feel" is an inadequate approach for strategic thought.</p>

        <p>A map of a competitive business <strong>Landscape</strong> (a Wardley Map) is also visual and context-specific, but instead of magnetic North, the anchor is the User being served and their corresponding needs. And instead of troops, the map contains a value chain — capabilities necessary to fulfill the needs, arranged according to their dependency relationships.</p>

        <p>The position of the capabilities on a Wardley Map is dependent on two aspects:
            <ol>
                <li>Visibility to the user, which is a natural outcome of a component's relative position within the value chain, manually adjusted as needed.</li>

        <h1>Making a Map</h1>
        <p>Wardley Mapping is a straight-forward process, and most difficulties boil down to concerns about making "mistakes" or doing the "wrong" thing. It is much more valuable to discard these concerns up-front, embrace the messiness of the process, and learn by boldly doing.</p>
        <p>The process of mapping is also the process of constructing a model of reality. An incorrect model that is also useful is the definition of success.</p>
        <p>To make a map:
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the <strong>Users</strong> being served</li>
                <li>Identify the <strong>Needs</strong> to be met (think of these as top-level Capabilities)</li>
                <li>Identify the <strong>Capabilities</strong> needed to successfully meet those needs</li>
                <li>Determine the stage of <strong>Evolution</strong> for each Capability by evaluating its characteristics (if it's difficult to decide, try breaking the Capability down into multiple, smaller Capabilities)</li>
                <li>Draw the complete value chain — User at the top, Needs and Capabilities underneath, with dependency relationships included and Capabilities placed in Stages I, II, III, or IV of Evolution</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The process can also look something like this...</p>

        <h1>Climate</h1>
        <p>While understanding the competitive Landscape is extremely helpful, it's also important to understand the <strong>Climate</strong> — the external forces acting upon it. These are the broader rules of the game, the patterns of the seasons, and competitor actions.</p>
        <p>Below are two patterns you've already encountered.</p>

        <h2>Pattern 1: Everything Evolves Through Supply and Demand Competition</h2>
        <p>If the conditions exist that a person or groups of people will strive to gain some form of advantage or control over others due to a constraint (i.e. a limitation of a resource or time or money or people) then we have competition.</p>
        <p>If competition exists then the components effected will evolve until they become industrialised. This impacts everything from activities (what we do), practices (how we do something), data (how we measure something) to knowledge (how we understand something).</p>

        <h2>Pattern 2: Characteristics Change as Capabilities Evolve</h2>
        <p>The characteristics of a component in the uncharted space are not the same as the characteristics of the same component when it becomes industrialised.</p>
        <p>A company has to manage both the extremes along with the evolution between them. It’s really important to remember that there is a transition from uncharted to industrialised. Don’t organise by the extremes alone.</p>

Fortunately in today’s climate then most competitors act as blind players in which case you do not need to dwell too much on their actions. When you make a move, they are unlikely to understand why or counter you. In the near future, given the potential interest in business algorithms, they maybe even become anticipatable blind automatons following coded secrets of success. In much the same way that Dan Mirvish noted that when Anne Hathaway was in the news, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway’s shares went up due to suspected sentiment analysis run by robotic trading platforms. This could make the game even easier.">

If competition exists then the components effected will evolve until they become industrialised. This impacts everything from activities (what we do), practices (how we do something), data (how we measure something) to knowledge (how we understand something). The map is never static but dynamic. It’s also important to understand that if competition exists then you will be in conflict with others. Sometimes the best way of resolving this is through coopetition (i.e. cooperative competition) and building alliances. In other cases, depending upon the context, then you have to fight even to the point of a game of last man standing. In any significant landscape then you’re likely to find yourself building alliances on one part of the map whilst at the same time fighting other companies in another and withdrawing from a third. However as the components on your map evolve then your former allies can become foes and vice versa. Microsoft and open source used to be mortal enemies, they’re now often found to be best buddies. To manage such a dynamic and fluid environment then you’re going to need to be able to observe it.">

Every instance of an evolving act will diffuse through its applicable market. Those markets will change as the act evolves i.e. the market for the first custom built phones is not the same as market for more industrialised phones. The process of evolution can include sustaining, incremental and discontinuous change e.g. product to product improvements or product to product substitution. This path is not smooth, it is not linear, it has many branches and dead ends (e.g. phones that failed). Furthermore the actions of individual players are unpredictable. Hence you can know the direction (e.g. phones will industrialise over time) but not the steps and the exact path taken (this phone will be more successful than that phone) until you have walked it.">

The one thing that standing still will guarantee is that you will be overtaken. The Red Queen has a secondary effect which is by adaptation then competitors limit the growth of a single company and prevent a run away process.">

You have to gamble with the novel but there’s also the potential for huge rewards. As the component evolves, its potential for differential value declines as it becomes more ubiquitous in its applicable market. This also means that any component that has not reached ubiquity must retain some uncertainty and some element of risk. The only conditions where a well understood, almost risk free component exists that is not ubiquitous and is of high value is when there is some form of restriction on competition e.g. a constraint through patents or monopoly. Care must also be taken not to confuse the terms common as in “everyone has one” with ubiquity to its applicable market. Many components have resource constraints (e.g. gold) or the market need is specific (e.g. wigs for barristers and judges).">

What you want to avoid is taking exceptional people out of their role and putting them into something they are not suited to simply because they think that is the only way to progress. Leadership, management and engineering are all aptitudes, they are all valuable and they have to work in concert. If the hierarchy of your organisation uniformly reflects your pay scales then you’re likely to be draining talent from where it should be and putting it into roles that it is not suited for. This is often done for arguments of “responsibility” or “managing bigger teams” (which also causes people to try and accumulate empires) or “spreading experience” or “career path” but there are alternative ways of achieving this. Taking a gifted engineer and turning them into a mediocre project manager is not wise. This is probably one of the most difficult areas as ego is quickly encountered.">

        <h2>Additional Instructions</h2>
        <p>By examining the doctrine in an organization, you can get an idea of how adaptable it is and how well it will respond to external change or gameplay. You can do this with your own organization, or with other organizations.</p>
        <p>In-person? Gather several people from different levels of the organization and perform the above self-assessment together. Distributed? See <a target="_blank" href="http://justin.stach.uk/doctrine_grid_tool">this form-based assessment</a> by Justin Stach.</p>
        <p>Once you've assessed the current state of doctrine in your organization, you can go about addressing areas of weakness, starting with the first phase.</p>

        <h1>Leadership (Gameplay)</h1>
        <p>Given your Purpose, the Landscape, the Climate, and your Doctrine, now you can make an informed decision about which strategy is appropriate for the context and take action against it.</p>

        <h2>Conditions and Consequences</h2>
        <p>For most of us, the traditional idea behind strategy is the deployment of people against some objective. "If we do <em>X</em>, then we will achieve <em>Y</em>!" This approach entails a "means-ends" model, which creates only first-order effects and limits leadership to the choice of which objective to pursue.</p>
        <p>An alternative approach is to examine the <em>conditions</em> that would make desirable <em>consequences</em> inevitable. Instead of pursuing one particular objective, the cultivation of the inherent potential within the situation to enable second-order effects makes many different desirable outcomes possible. Means-ends thinking is tactical in nature, while conditions-consequences thinking makes a grand-strategic approach possible.</p>
        <p>Think of it like tending a garden. What are the conditions that enable life? Success isn't about putting seeds in the ground. Success is an inevitable outcome when the seeds, soil, lighting, watering, weeding, pruning, pest control, temperature, and seasons are all considered and integrated into a complete picture of what it means to have a garden. Any one of those conditions can threaten the success of the garden if not accounted for.</p>
        <p>When you map, think about second-order interventions. Once you get past the basic doctrinal problems, like correcting bias, reducing duplication, focusing on user needs, and making maps in general, you'll start to reflect your more strategic intentions in the maps themselves (e.g., "We want to accelerate the evolution of <em>this</em> component."). The least brilliant thing to do at this point, however, is to brute force your way to that outcome.</p>
        <p>Instead, study the inherent potential of the context closely. What are the indirect options that create multiple desirable possibilities, of which that outcome is one? See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Deciphering-Sun-Tzu-How-Read/dp/0199373515">Deciphering Sun Tzu</a> for a more in-depth exploration of these ideas.</p>

                <p>To increase competition in content, the obvious option is to cause the industrialization (evolution) of the creative studios. More competition among studios would result in more, better content, so how could we make that happen?</p>
                <p>A naive move might be to launch an independent creative studio or form a strategic partnership to advance one particular studio, but that game can all-too-easily be lost. There are more interesting options in the lower-level constraints (a Fool's Mate).</p>
                <p>If there were more competition among production systems, for example, the barrier to entry for new talent and therefore new creative studios would be lowered. An open approach would accelerate that process, indirectly causing increased competition among creative studios and ultimately content.</p>
                <p>Chances are, the existing creative studios won't have the situational awareness to recognize the play for what it is. In fact, they might support it in the name of short-term cost savings. Wild!
